# c_shell

I created my own shell in the C programming language as part of a module at university which looked at architectures and operating systems. The functionality of this shell is similar to that of bash, fish or zsh which you will have likely used before if you're familiar with Linux. After running the code, you will be presented with a terminal window which you can use to input commands and experiment with the program. Please ensure you are using a Unix-based operating system for this or alternatively WSL on Windows.
